    // Ways to create JavaScript objects
    // as described by Stoyan: http://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/

    /*

        - JavaScript classes introduced in ECMAScript 6 are syntactical sugar over
        JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax is
        not introducing a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript.
        JavaScript classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create
        objects and deal with inheritance.

        - there are no classes in JavaScript (JavaScript is a class-less language)

        - In JavaScript everything is an object. And when it comes to
        inheritance, objects inherit from objects, not classes from classes as
        in the "class"-ical languages.

    // 1. Using a function (new keyword)

    function Fruit (name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = 0;
        this.age = 0;

        // methods defined internally
        this.getInfo = function () {
            return "name: " + this.name + ", age: " + this.age;
        };
    }

    // Defining methods using the prototype
    Fruit.prototype.makeOlder = function (years) {
        this.age += years;
    };

    const apple = new Fruit("jab≈Çko");
    apple.age++;
    apple.age++;
    apple.age++;
    apple.makeOlder(10);
    console.log(apple.getInfo());



    // 2. Using object literals (singleton)

    // const obj1 = new Object(); // Object literal is preferred over the new Object()
    const obj1 = {};
    console.log(obj1);

    const obj2 = {
        name: "Kuba",
    };
    console.log(obj2);

    // 3. Singleton using combination of methods 1 and 2

    const animal = new function() {
        this.name = name;
    }();

    console.log(animal);
    console.log("koniec");

})();
